ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* Icon

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => wooduUnity/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => wooduUnity/src/main/assets/
* libs/QCARUnityPlayer.jar => wooduUnity/libs/QCARUnityPlayer.jar
* libs/Vuforia.jar => wooduUnity/libs/Vuforia.jar
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libQCARUnityPlayer.so => wooduUnity/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libQCARUnityPlayer.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libQCARWrapper.so => wooduUnity/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libQCARWrapper.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libVuforia.so => wooduUnity/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libVuforia.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libmain.so => wooduUnity/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libmain.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libmono.so => wooduUnity/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libmono.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libunity.so => wooduUnity/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libunity.so
* libs/unity-classes.jar => wooduUnity/libs/unity-classes.jar
* res/ => wooduUnity/src/main/res/
* src/ => wooduUnity/src/main/java/
* src/Icon => wooduUnity/src/main/resources/Icon
* src/in/Icon => wooduUnity/src/main/resources/in/Icon
* src/in/wooduUnity/Icon => wooduUnity/src/main/resources/in/wooduUnity/Icon

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
